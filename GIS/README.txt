SOLAR SITE SUITABILITY ANALYSIS
This script is a work in progress. The GIS Analysis for the  ase study deomnstrated in our project submission was
performed manually with QGIS.

The end goal was to produce a working Python script for integration with QGIS which would allow Site Suitability to
become repeatable and extendable. What you see in the scripts below is our intentions of the basic structure and
how the script would operate.

These Python scripts have been written for PyQGIS. They are designed to be run directly through the Python Console
in the QGIS program. To do this, open QGIS, and in the top bar, go to Plugins > Python Console. Click Show Editor,
and from there you can Open a .py file.
